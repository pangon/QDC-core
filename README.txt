QDC (quick direct-method controlled) is an optimized exact implementation of the Gillespie's direct-method.
It is designed for biochemical simulations when there is the need of dynamic parameters whose values can change during the simulation.

The core package contains only the simulation tools, without a graphical interface or output graphical viewer.
The full version of QDC vith installers, graphical interface and additional utility tools is available at https://github.com/ejfresch/qdc (maintained by Luca Freschi) and at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gillespie-qdc/
